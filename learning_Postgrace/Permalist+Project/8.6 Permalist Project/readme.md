- Edit existing items.
- Delete items from the list.
- Display the list of items in a user-friendly interface.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- PostgreSQL
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/permalist-project.git
    cd permalist-project
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up PostgreSQL database**:
    - Create a PostgreSQL database named [`permalist`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fe%3A%2Fwork%2FLearningBackend%2Flearning_Postgrace%2FPermalist%2BProject%2F8.6%20Permalist%20Project%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d606d643-08ff-4a42-90d3-473b6d916f0d%22%5D "Go to definition").
    - Create a table named [`items`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fe%3A%2Fwork%2FLearningBackend%2Flearning_Postgrace%2FPermalist%2BProject%2F8.6%20Permalist%20Project%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A21%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d606d643-08ff-4a42-90d3-473b6d916f0d%22%5D "Go to definition") with the following schema:
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE items (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
        );
        ```

4. **Configure database connection**:
    - Update the database connection details in 

index.js

 if necessary:
        ```javascript
        const db = new pg.Client({
          user: "postgres",
          host: "localhost",
          database: "permalist",
          password: "0000",
          port: 5432,
        });
        ```

## Usage

1. **Start the server**:
    ```sh
    nodemon index.js
    ```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
